# ⚙️ ArcUp — How We Work (Merged v1)

ArcUp is more than an idea — it’s a **way of building**. Open, rigorous, regenerative, and fair.

## 1) RE\:TECH — Our approach to innovation (and being human with tech)

**Re‑think · Re‑align · Re‑make  Re‑share**

Technology does not define us; it should **support** us. RE\:TECH is a posture that keeps technology at the **edge of our fingertips** — a reflection of our principles, a way we interact with the world to make change.

- **Open by default, non‑extractive by design** — decentralize knowledge *and* discourse; the artifacts and the conversations are public.
- Works **with nature and people; future‑conscious** — choices consider downstream effects across communities and generations.
- **Interdependence acknowledged** — we reconcile with enduring laws of interaction between humans and living systems; design makes those relationships explicit.
- **Safety first** — from electrical handling to ecological and animal ethics. If a path tends toward harm (e.g., weaponization), **we stop**.

*(Deeper dive on RE*\*:TECH\*\* lives on its own page; this is the working posture.)\*

## 2) Principles in Action

*Our principles turn values into constraints for how we design and implement. RE*\*:TECH\*\* operationalizes these in practice.\*

- 👥 **Circle of care (human dignity)** — universal dignity & rights; anti‑discrimination; active bias work; ensure people have resources to thrive.
- 🐾 **Animal ethics** — **no invasive animal experimentation**. Prefer non‑invasive approaches (in‑situ observation, eDNA, epigenetic markers) and design to avoid harm.
- 🌱 **Environmental restoration** — measure impact by what heals.
- 🔄 **Iterative humility & scientific method** — hypothesis → test → document → replicate → adapt; learning is the product, not perfection.
- 🌍 **Global majority orientation** — plural, future‑conscious humanity; center perspectives from the global majority.
- 🔓 **Openness with responsibility** — transparency by default; share‑alike guardrails; decentralize knowledge and discourse.

These principles are not slogans; they guide how we design, document, share, and respond to challenges.

## 3) Method & Transparency — How We Work Together

**Open research, end‑to‑end.**

- **Document early**: experiments are logged from the idea stage (not only after results).
- **Show the work**: methods, parameters, safety notes, raw data, decisions, and rationale are published.
- **Invite review**: data is shared for collective analysis and peer feedback (open notebooks, open protocols, replication standards).
- **Track status**: each project has WIP notes, status indicators, and changelogs.
- **Credit everyone**: attribution ledger, version history, and contribution maps; cite contributors in public outputs.
- **Community consent & co‑design**: nothing about communities *without* communities; engagement is informed and voluntary.
- **Replicate**: results are only “claims” after independent replication and safety checks.

*Iterative humility: being “in progress” is normal. Accessibility matters: content is written for mixed backgrounds and translated where possible.*

## 4) Safety Framework

**Safety is non‑negotiable. Compliance with local laws and regulations is required.**

**Researchers (labs, institutions)**

- Perform documented **risk assessments** aligned with relevant standards.
- Maintain **equipment safety**: HV isolation, interlocks, PPE, lock‑out/tag‑out.
- **Ecological & animal ethics**: assess off‑target impacts; **no invasive animal use**; prefer non‑invasive observation, eDNA, and epigenetic markers.
- Report **incidents and near‑misses**; publish corrective actions.

**DIY / Citizen Experimenters**

- Use **plain‑language guidance** for HV safety, shielding, ventilation, and water handling.
- Only operate **within legal limits**; no unapproved grid‑tied experiments.
- Start **low‑risk prototypes** (benchtop, low energy) with clear stop rules.
- Share **observations and issues** so the community can improve guidance.

> If a path tends toward harm (e.g., weaponization, human rights abuse, ecological damage), **we stop** and issue a public advisory.

## 5) Licensing & Protection

ArcUp is **open** — but not a free‑for‑all. Our licenses keep the commons open while preventing extractive capture.

- **Site text & frameworks (this website):** **CC BY‑NC‑SA** — credit required, non‑commercial, share‑alike.
- **Hardware designs:** **CERN OHL‑S** — open hardware with strong share‑alike; modifications must be published.
- **Software:** **AGPL‑3.0** — networked use must share code back.
- **Data:** **ODC‑BY / CC BY‑SA** — open data with attribution; use‑case dependent.

**Commercial Alignment Agreement (CAA)**

- For proprietary/closed integrations, partners sign a CAA covering: benefit‑sharing (commons fund), attribution, disclosure of modifications, and annual social/environmental impact reporting.

**Consulting firewall**

- Contributors may offer **private consulting** based on expertise. Deliverables built on ArcUp materials remain under ArcUp licenses — **no relicensing or closing the commons**.

**Misuse response**

- ArcUp may issue **safety advisories**, request compliance/cessation, and pursue **legal action** for license or ethics violations.

## 6) Governance & Power

**Now:** founder‑led seed — **arc^ by Ali**.\
**Later:** as the community grows, governance can transition to a **foundation/federation** with shared power.

- **Mission lock / red‑line veto**: during early years, the founder can block decisions enabling eugenics, human rights abuse, weaponization, or severe ecological harm. This dissolves once diverse governance matures.
- **Open participation**: aligned contributors can propose projects, mentor, translate, design, or run studies.
- **Consent‑based decisions & transparency**: use open RFCs, documented reasoning, and visible budgets/minutes; major changes seek consent from affected stakeholders.

---

## 7) Money & Fairness

Open tech ≠ unpaid labour.

- **Paid work**: services, deployments, custom builds, and integrations can be paid.
- **Share value**: if ArcUp earns, **contributors share in the value** — this is not a forever‑volunteer model.
- **Keep the commons intact**: commercial partnerships run through clear agreements (e.g., CAA) that fund the commons and require openness where it matters.

## 8) Your Next Moves

- **Contribute** — documentation, research, design, translation, mentoring.
- **Propose** — a project or local use‑case.
- **Partner** — explore service work or Commercial Alignment Agreements.
