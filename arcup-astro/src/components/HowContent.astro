          <li><strong>Human dignity first.</strong> No exploitation, extractive labor, or coercion. Contributors are resourced and credited.</li>
          <li><strong>Center the margins.</strong> Prioritize perspectives from communities most impacted by environmental harm and least served by existing systems.</li>

        <h3>How We Practice</h3>

          <li><strong>Iterative humility.</strong> We hypothesis → test → document → share → revise. Mistakes are expected; hiding them isn't.</li>
          <li><strong>Consent-based participation.</strong> Communities are partners, not subjects. Engagement is informed, voluntary, and shaped by local knowledge.</li>
          <li><strong>Replicate before we claim.</strong> A single study isn't proof. Results become recommendations only after independent replication.</li>

      <h3>What This Looks Like in Practice</h3>

      <ol class="example-steps">
        <li><strong>Document early:</strong> Hypothesis, equipment specs, and safety protocols published in GitHub repo before starting.</li>
        <li><strong>Show the work:</strong> Plasma device schematics (CERN OHL), treatment parameters, seed sources, soil composition — all logged openly.</li>
        <li><strong>Invite review:</strong> Local ecologists and safety experts review protocol before experiments begin.</li>
        <li><strong>Track status:</strong> Experiment marked "WIP — Week 3 of 8" with live updates in shared notebook.</li>
        <li><strong>Credit everyone:</strong> Garden members, equipment designers, and reviewers all listed in final report.</li>
        <li><strong>Co-design:</strong> Garden community chooses which native species to test based on restoration goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Replicate:</strong> Protocol shared so other gardens can test with their local species before we make claims.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="example-outcome"><strong>Outcome:</strong> Data stays open (CC-BY-SA), hardware designs stay open (CERN OHL), and the garden owns the knowledge about their land.</p>
