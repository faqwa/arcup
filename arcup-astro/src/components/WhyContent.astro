        <h3>Our Approach to Building</h3>
        <p>
          We publish early and deliberately: prototypes, experiment notebooks, versioned protocols, modular components 
          that others can adopt, test, and extend. Our goal is <strong>reproducible momentum</strong>, not a private patent on a shelf.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discovery should belong to many, not to a privileged few. Scale must be bound to consent and repair.
