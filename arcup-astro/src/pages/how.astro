          <p>
            For over a century, innovation followed the same path: war &rarr; industry &rarr; patents &rarr; profit.
            The result? Concentrated power, ecological harm, erased knowledge.
            <strong>RE:TECH asks: if we build this, what world does it create?</strong>
            If the answer trends toward harm, we stop.

        <ul class="approach-pill-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Open by default, non-extractive by design.</strong>
            Research, designs, and data are public from day one. Knowledge and its discourse stay in the commons.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Future-conscious.</strong>
            Every choice considers long-term impacts on communities and ecosystems. We ask "what happens in 10 years?" before we build.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ecological interdependence.</strong>
            Humans aren't separate from nature. Our work respects and repairs the living systems we're part of.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Safety as non-negotiable.</strong>
            High-voltage plasma is dangerous. Ecological applications need monitoring. If harm is likely&mdash;weaponization, exploitation, ecocide&mdash;we don't proceed.

            <li><strong>Human dignity first.</strong> No exploitation, extractive labor, or coercion. Contributors are resourced and credited.</li>
            <li><strong>Center the margins.</strong> Prioritize perspectives from communities most impacted by environmental harm and least served by existing systems.</li>
            <li><strong>No harm to non-humans.</strong> No invasive animal testing. We use observation, eDNA, and non-invasive methods to study ecosystems.</li>

          <h3>How we work</h3>

            <li><strong>Consent-based participation.</strong> Communities are partners, not subjects. Engagement is informed, voluntary, and shaped by local knowledge.</li>
            <li><strong>Replicate before we claim.</strong> A single study isn't proof. Results become recommendations only after independent replication.</li>

            <li><strong>No patent lockdown.</strong> Knowledge stays open. Commercial use requires benefit-sharing back to the commons.</li>

          <li><strong>Document early:</strong> Hypothesis, equipment specs, and safety protocols published in GitHub repo before starting.</li>
          <li><strong>Show the work:</strong> Plasma device schematics (CERN OHL), treatment parameters, seed sources, soil composition&mdash;all logged openly.</li>

          <li><strong>Co-design:</strong> Garden community chooses which native species to test based on restoration goals.</li>
